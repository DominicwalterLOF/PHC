Thus we provide a door step service for all the medical needs of the citizens.Further under emergency situations people will be able to contact the doctor immediately.software implementation: A mobile app and a website to cater the needs of the users, the app specifically shows alerts regarding abnormality in their health, their upcoming appointments, and previous visits. Further the users will be able to access their medical history, previous visits and will even have an option to request medical stock. We provide a web app for the hospital end which will have separate access: admin, medical team and inventory & token system. Medical team can view the patient's medical history, their visits, upload and update prescriptions and other details.
